Detect Features Impotance
===

## Intro
Features' importance - is a powerful ML technique to find the most important features that bring most prediction power. Imagine you have hundreds of columns in the dataset. The Features' importance method finds only several say 5-10 those bring 90-95% of the prediction power. It brings insight into the data - what makes the value to the prediction ML model?! Other data can be reduced that makes the calculation faster and more accurate!

## Prerequisites

You need to use Python 3.7 and later version. 

## Install needed python modules

```markdown
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pyod xgboost
```

## How to

We use the Random Forest ML model to detect features' importance.
